# mds

Serves Markdown documents as static content via the express view rendering system.

This module differs from other markdown file serving modules in that it passes the markdown to a view template so that it can be included in styled output consistent with the rest of a web application views.

The general use case is documentation that you wish to appear inline within your web application but also function in the context of a github repository. Styled content within the web application and unstyled raw markdown documentation within github.

## Documentation

Raw markdown [documentation](/doc/index.md) is in the repository.

## Installation

	npm install mds

## Developers

Clone the repository and run:

	npm install && npm start

You should then be able to see the demo server at:

	http://localhost:3000
